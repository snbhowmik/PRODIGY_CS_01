# PRODIGY_CS_01 - CEASAR CIPHER PROGRAM
This Python project implements the ceasar cipher, a simple and easy to use cipher where each letter in the plaintext is replaced by some other letter which is some fixed number of positions ahead of the original letter in English Alphabet.

### How it works
- Takes a plaintext as input
- Shifts each letter by a specified number of positions (key)
- Returns the encrypted or decrypted message

### Usage
* Clone the repository
* Run the Python Script
* Follow on Screen prompts to enter message, shift value (key) and whether to encrypt or decrypt
